# ADA Theory Assignments

## Overview

This repository contains theory assignments completed as part of the Algorithm Design and Analysis course. The assignments cover various fundamental concepts of algorithm design, analysis, and complexity theory.

## Assignments Covered

1. **Introduction to Algorithms**: Covers basic concepts such as algorithm analysis, asymptotic notation (Big O, Big Omega, Big Theta), and understanding algorithm efficiency.

2. **Divide and Conquer**: Explores the Divide and Conquer paradigm, including algorithms like Merge Sort, Quick Sort, and Strassen's Matrix Multiplication. Also covers recurrence relations and their solution techniques.

3. **Greedy Algorithms**: Discusses greedy algorithms and their applications, including algorithms like Huffman Coding, Dijkstra's Shortest Path, and the Knapsack Problem.

4. **Dynamic Programming**: Covers dynamic programming techniques and applications, such as the Longest Common Subsequence, Matrix Chain Multiplication, and the 0/1 Knapsack Problem.

5. **Graph Algorithms**: Explores various graph algorithms, including Depth-First Search (DFS), Breadth-First Search (BFS), Minimum Spanning Trees (Prim's and Kruskal's algorithms), and Shortest Paths (Dijkstra's and Bellman-Ford algorithms).

6. **Network Flow**: Discusses algorithms related to network flow, such as Ford-Fulkerson algorithm for Maximum Flow, and Edmonds-Karp algorithm.

7. **NP-Completeness**: Introduces the concept of NP-Completeness, covering topics like polynomial-time reductions, Cook's theorem, and examples of NP-Complete problems.

## Conclusion

The ADA theory assignments provide a comprehensive overview of fundamental concepts in algorithm design and analysis. By covering a wide range of topics and emphasizing problem-solving skills, the assignments help students develop a strong foundation for further studies and practical applications in the field of algorithms.
